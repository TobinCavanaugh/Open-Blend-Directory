# Open-Blend-Directory
#### An cross platform addon for Blender that lets you press Alt + Shift + R to open the directory of your save file!

### What it does
- Reveal the location of the currently opened blend file in the explorer. On windows and mac, it automatically selects the file as well.

### How to use it
#### Installation:
1. Download the OpenBlendDirectory.py from the releases tab. (DO NOT DOWNLOAD AS ZIP, THAT WILL NOT WORK).
1. In Blender, Edit > Preferences > Addons > Install.
2. Locate the OpenBlendDirectory.py and double click it.
3. Enable the Open Blend Directory by pressing the checkbox to make it checked.

#### Use:
- Press Alt + Shift + R, it will open an explorer window with the file selected

#### Customization
#### How to change keybinds
1. Edit > Preferences > Keymap
2. Search "Open Blend Directory"
3. Change the keybind to your liking

### Why I made this
- This is a super basic addon, I just wanted it because I hate having to find the saved directory of my Blender project every time I want to add textures to it.

### What does it support
- This should be cross platform, I use system commands, so it should be really simple to add support for different operating systems, it's just a matter of what platform.system gives you.
