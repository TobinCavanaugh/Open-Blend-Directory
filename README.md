# Open-Blend-Directory
#### An cross platform addon for Blender that lets you press Alt + Shift + R to open the directory of your save file!

### What it does
Reveal the location of the currently opened blend file in the explorer. On windows and mac, it automatically selects the file as well.

### How to use it
Press Alt + Shift + R
Or,
Change the keybinds in Edit > Preferences > Keymap > Open Blend Directory

### Why I made this
This is a super basic addon, I just wanted it because I hate having to find the saved directory of my Blender project every time I want to add textures to it.

### What does it support
This should be cross platform, I use system commands, so it should be really simple to add support for different operating systems, it's just a matter of what platform.system gives you.
